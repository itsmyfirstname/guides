## Management
Almost all dev teams follow an [Agile Framework](https://www.atlassian.com/agile),  there are many career paths from [scrum master](https://www.scrumalliance.org),  or really any item on the [main diagram here](https://www.scaledagileframework.com)

Using [AWS certs](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learn-about/?nc2=sb_tr_la) as a proxy of "things" you can learn more generally, comb through and see if anything peaks your interest, and try to gauge your interest vs your goals/timeline. I'd treat their cert categories as a pre-sorted topic or discipline to dig into further.
