# Pages and Tutorials

If you find yourself needing additional tools, programs, or general utilities that are not bundled with your chromebook _and_ are, too cheap to buy a mac (me included), then this should help you limp by. At least until that 1/1000 of a bitcoin your buddy talked you into buying touches the moon; when that day comes, Macbooks for everyone! but I digress. 


## Useful Cloud Solutions

I would be remiss if I did not first recommend using a web based platform for your extra duties.
Chances are there is a free(mium) cloud based solution that will be perfectly serviceable in contrast to bootstrapping your chromebook to do something its not necessarily capable of.

### Replit

REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop. [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) is a web based [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) which enables you to create multiple projects utilizing various languages.

Last I checked the following were supported:
- Python
- Java
- R
- Node
- C
- React
- Ruby
- Go
- ...and more

### Codeanywhere

Same as above; maybe easier to use. Depends on the individual but I personally enjoy [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/)

### Other Cloud Providers
- R
    - [R Studio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)
- Python
    - [trinket](https://trinket.io/console)



## Hacking Your Chromebook
If your a purist and don't want the internets seeing your junk, try a manual install. 

> *Disclaimer* performance will be subpar, chromebooks are not designed for heavy compute tasks. 

1. [Enable Linux (if enabled skip to the desired tool)](./enabling-linux.html)
2. [Install R and R-Studio](./installing-r.html)
3. [Install Python](): TBD
