I went with AT&amp;T and had minimal issues . Limitations . | You will have to be comfortable logging into the router occasionally and make some changes. Their customer support is phenomenal and was always there to help, even on sunday nights. | Related to above, the sim would frequently get booted off the network, requiring restarts, band locking, or signal boosting adjustments . | The products below made these problems a non issue | . | .
