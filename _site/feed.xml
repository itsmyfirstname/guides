<h3 id="rural-isp-viper-broadband">Rural ISP: Viper Broadband</h3>

<p>My ISP of choice is <a href="https://www.viperbroadband.com/">Viper Broadband</a>, they offer 2 <a href="https://www.viperbroadband.com/#our-plans">plans</a> im aware of:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.viperbroadband.com/product/blue-plan/">Blue Plan</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.viperbroadband.com/product/pink-plan/">Pink Plan</a></li>
</ol>

<p>both plans are the same price, not sure how they differ performance wise.</p>

<p>I went with AT&amp;T and had minimal issues. Once I installed the signal booster I was regularly getting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">100mbps</code>. The worst I saw was 25 down and 2 up…in the middle of buttf**ked Indiana.</p>

<h5 id="limitations">Limitations</h5>
<ol>
  <li>You will have to be comfortable logging into the router occasionally and make some changes. Their customer support is phenomenal and was always there to help, even on sunday nights.</li>
  <li>Related to above, the sim would frequently get booted off the network, requiring restarts, band locking, or signal boosting adjustments
    <ul>
      <li>The products below made these problems a non issue</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="supporting-items">Supporting Items</h3>

<p>Effectively using you cellphone as your router will come with its own drawbacks. Service can be spotty, weak, and unreliable. Personally, the items below improved my quality of life, so I feel obligated to at least make mention of them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>4g Signal Booster
Boosts primary AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon bands
    <blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/35Rusb5">Cell Phone Signal Booster</a></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Net10 Sim Cards
    <blockquote>
      <p>Back up ATT <a href="https://amzn.to/3pz3Rqo">Sim Cards</a> (Check with Viper if these work with their pink plan) I always kept a few of these around, incase I was having connectivity issues. AT&amp;T is not a fan of these grandfathered unlimited plans, so they occasionally make system changes resulting in invalidated sim cards. When/if this happens, you’d have to wait for Viper to send you a new one (could take days), or have these on hand <em>just in case</em>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Cell Tower Tracker
    <blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://www.cellmapper.net/map">Cell Mapper</a> 
This site is very helpful if figuring what bands are available, and which band you can lock to for the strongest signal.</p>
