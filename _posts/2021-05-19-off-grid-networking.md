The *R* in **Remote** is capitalized for a reason. Im not here to recommend whatever ISP you are shoehorned into subscribing to. This is strictly for those looking to stay online while getting off the grid. I personally ran this set up when I traveled the country in my RV and would do it again in a heartbeat. 

### Rural ISP: Viper Broadband

My ISP of choice is [Viper Broadband](https://www.viperbroadband.com/), they offer 2 [plans](https://www.viperbroadband.com/#our-plans) im aware of:
1. The [Blue Plan](https://www.viperbroadband.com/product/blue-plan/)
2. The [Pink Plan](https://www.viperbroadband.com/product/pink-plan/)

both plans are the same price, not sure how they differ performance wise.

I went with AT&T and had minimal issues. Once I installed the signal booster I was regularly getting `100mbps`. The worst I saw was 25 down and 2 up...in the middle of buttf**ked Indiana. 

##### Limitations
1. You will have to be comfortable logging into the router occasionally and make some changes. Their customer support is phenomenal and was always there to help, even on sunday nights. 
2. Related to above, the sim would frequently get booted off the network, requiring restarts, band locking, or signal boosting adjustments
   - The products below made these problems a non issue

### Supporting Items 

Effectively using you cellphone as your router will come with its own drawbacks. Service can be spotty, weak, and unreliable. Personally, the items below improved my quality of life, so I feel obligated to at least make mention of them. 

- 4g Signal Booster
Boosts primary AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon bands
> [Cell Phone Signal Booster](https://amzn.to/35Rusb5)

- Net10 Sim Cards
>Back up ATT [Sim Cards](https://amzn.to/3pz3Rqo) (Check with Viper if these work with their pink plan) I always kept a few of these around, incase I was having connectivity issues. AT&T is not a fan of these grandfathered unlimited plans, so they occasionally make system changes resulting in invalidated sim cards. When/if this happens, you'd have to wait for Viper to send you a new one (could take days), or have these on hand _just in case_.

- Cell Tower Tracker
> [Cell Mapper](https://www.cellmapper.net/map) 
This site is very helpful if figuring what bands are available, and which band you can lock to for the strongest signal.
