# Overview

Linux is still in beta, so not all devices are supported. Since ChromeOS is opensource under the covers, there are various hardware configurations making it hard to support linux out of the box for every device running chromeos. Thankfully its easy enough to enable if your device is supported. 

## Gather Device Info
First identify your make, model, manufacturer, and model. You may already know it, have the box, or can google what you know about your device and match the picture, or you can check the inventory tag on the bottom:

1. Turn device over
2. Look for a sticker on the bottom (will most likely have a barcode on it)
3. Write down relevant information

## Validate Linux Compatibility
Once your confident you have the proper device information, head over to Chrominium and search for your device to see if its listed as a [Chrome OS System Supporting Linux](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux)


If you found your device, you're good to go!

## Enable
you can go ahead and follow the instructions managed by Google on how to [Enable Linux on ChromeOS](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439)
