## Internet Providers

### Viper Broadband

My ISP of choice is [Viper Broadband](https://www.viperbroadband.com/), they offer 2 [plans](https://www.viperbroadband.com/#our-plans) im aware of:
1. The [Blue Plan](https://www.viperbroadband.com/product/blue-plan/)
   - aka AT&T
2. The [Pink Plan](https://www.viperbroadband.com/product/pink-plan/)
   - aka T-Mobile

both plans are the same price, not sure how they differ performance wise.

I went with AT&T and had minimal issues

### Limitations
1. You will have to be comfortable logging into the router occasionally and make some changes. Their customer support is phenomenal and was always there to help, even on sunday nights. 
2. Related to above, the sim would frequently get booted off the network, requiring restarts, band locking, or signal boosting adjustments
