# Overview


## Internet Providers

### Viper Broadband

My ISP of choice is [Viper Broadband](https://www.viperbroadband.com/), they offer 2 [plans](https://www.viperbroadband.com/#our-plans) im aware of:
1. The [Blue Plan](https://www.viperbroadband.com/product/blue-plan/)
   - aka AT&T
2. The [Pink Plan](https://www.viperbroadband.com/product/pink-plan/)
   - aka T-Mobile

both plans are the same price, not sure how they differ performance wise.

I went with AT&T and had minimal issues

### Limitations
1. You will have to be comfortable logging into the router occasionally and make some changes. Their customer support is phenomenal and was always there to help, even on sunday nights. 
2. Related to above, the sim would frequently get booted off the network, requiring restarts, band locking, or signal boosting adjustments
   - The products below made these problems a non issue

### Recommendations

If you go with Viper I would check out the items below, as they really made this a solid choice. 

- Cell Booster
  - Boosts primary AT&T and Verizon bands

- Back up Sim Cards
  - I always kept a few of these around, incase I was having connectivity issues
  - The sim card slot for the router accepts the old school sim cards which are the size of SD cards, the sims in this kit will fit any device!

- Cell Tower Tracker
  - This site is very helpful if figuring what bands are available, and which band you can lock to for the strongest signal. 
    - [Cell Mapper](https://www.cellmapper.net/map)
